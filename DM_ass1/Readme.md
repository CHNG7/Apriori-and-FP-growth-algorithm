# Project Title
Generate frequent itemsets and interesting association  rules using​ Apriori and FP-growth algorithm
### Prerequisites
You need to have a c++ compiler(gcc).
### Running the program
Compile and execute rule_mining_apriori.cpp,rule_mining_Fptree.cpp
### About different files
input_reader.h---------Takes care of reading and preprocessing the input
output_writer.h--------Helps in generating different files(Frequent Items sets,association rules etc.)
apriori.h--------------contains the apriori algorithm
test.h-----------------Helps in genrating differnt output
rule_mining_apriori.cpp-----main program for apriori implementation
rule_mining_Fptree.cpp------Fptree implemetaion for frequent item set generation

### Results
FrequentItemmSets
Associaition Rules
Redundant Associaiton Rules
Closed Frequen Set
Maximal Frequent Set
